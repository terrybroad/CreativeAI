    "# Week 8: Word Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In this weeks sesssion we are going to be looking at word vectors. Word vectors (or *word embeddings*) are pretrained numerical representations of words, within a high-dimensional vector space. The number of dimensions for our word vectors is arbitrary and can range anywhere from 50 to 300 dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectors are calculated from very large datasets of texts, with the goal of words that are similiar being close to each other in vector space, and words being dissimilar being far away in vector space. After processing a vast amount of data, we end up with a unique vector for every word in the corpus. This gives us feature representations of words (that unlike other representations of words we have seen like one-hot, bag of words or TF-IDF) encode a representation that captures the meaning of the word. \n",
    "\n",
    "As these word vectors are **numerical representations**, we can perform mathematical functions on them to do some interesting (and revealing) insights into what kind of data and biases these models contain. \n",
