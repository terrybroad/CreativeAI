On top of old Smokey,
All covered with snow,
I lost my true lover
From courtin’ too slow.
From courtin’ too slow, dear,
From courtin’ too slow,
I lost my true lover
From courtin’ too slow.
On top of old Smokey,
I went for to weep,
For a false-hearted lover
Is worse than a thief.
Is worse than a thief, dear,
Is worse than a thief,
For a false-hearted lover
Is worse than a thief.
For a thief, he will rob you,
Of all that you have,
But a false-hearted lover
Will send you to your grave.
Will send you to your grave, dear,
Will send you to your grave,
But a false-hearted lover
Will send you to your grave.
He’ll hug you and kiss you,
And tell you more lies,
Than the ties of the railroad
Or the stars in the skies.
The stars in the skies, dear,
The stars in the skies,
He’ll tell you more lies, dear,
than the stars in the skies.
