Yankee Doodle went to town
A-riding on a pony,
Stuck a feather in his cap
And called it macaroniâ€™.
Chorus:
Yankee Doodle keep it up,
Yankee Doodle dandy,
Mind the music and the step,
And with the girls be handy.
Father and I went down to camp,
Along with Captain Gooding,
And there we saw the men and boys
As thick as hasty pudding.
Chorus
There was Captain Washington,
Upon a slapping stallion,
Giving orders to his men-
I guess there were a million.
Chorus
