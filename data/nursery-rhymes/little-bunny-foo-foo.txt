Little Bunny Foo Foo
Hopping through the forest,
Scooping up the field mice
And bopping them on the head.
And down, down, down came the Good Fairy, and said:
“Little Bunny Foo Foo
I don’t want to see you
Scooping up the field mice
And bopping them on the head.
I’m going to give you three chances,
And if you don’t behave,
And then, I’m going to turn you into a…GOOOOOON!”
Little Bunny Foo Foo
Hopping through the forest,
Scooping up the field mice
And bopping them on the head.
And down, down, down came the Good Fairy, and said:
“Little Bunny Foo Foo
I don’t want to see you
Scooping up the field mice
And bopping them on the head.
I’m going to give you two more chances,
And if you don’t behave,
And then, I am going to turn you into a…GOOOOOON!”
Little Bunny Foo Foo
Hopping through the forest,
Scooping up the field mice
And bopping them on the head.
And down, down, down came the Good Fairy, and said:
“Little Bunny Foo Foo
I don’t like your attitude
Scooping up the field mice
And bopping them on the head.
I’m going to give you one more chance,
And if you don’t behave,
And then, I am definitely going to turn you into a…GOOOOOON!
And it won’t be pretty!”
Little Bunny Foo Foo
Hopping through the forest,
Scooping up the field mice
And bopping them on the head.
“That’s it.”
Then the Good Fairy came down,
And then she turned Little Bunny Foo Foo into a…GOOOOOON!
And the moral of the story is:
“HARE TODAY, GOON TOMORROW”.
