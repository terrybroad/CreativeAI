Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn’t fuzzy
No, by gosh, he wasn’t, was he?
Silly Willy was a worm
Silly Willy wouldn’t squirm
Silly Willy wasn’t silly
No, by gosh, he wasn’t really
Iddy Biddy was a mouse
Iddy Biddy had no spouse
Iddy Biddy wasn’t pretty
Oh, by gosh, it was a pity
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn’t fuzzy
No, by god, he wasn’t, was he?
