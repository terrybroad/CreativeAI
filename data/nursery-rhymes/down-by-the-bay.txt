Down by the bay,
Where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home,
I dare not go,
For if I do,
My mother will say:
Did you ever see a goose,
Kissing a moose?
Down by the bay!

Where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home,
I dare not go,
For if I do,
My mother will say:
Did you ever see a llama,
Eating his pajamas?
Down by the bay!
Down by the bay,
Where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home,
I dare not go,
For if I do,
My mother will say:
Did you ever see a bear,
Combing his hair?
Down by the bay!
Down by the bay,
Where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home,
I dare not go,

My mother will say:
Did you ever see a whale,
With a polka dot tail?
Down by the bay!

Where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home,
I dare not go,
For if I do,
My mother will say:
Did you ever see a fly,
Wearing a tie?
Down by the bay!
Down by the bay,
Where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home,
I dare not go,
For if I do,
My mother will say:
Did you ever see a bee,
With a sunburned knee?
Down by the bay!

Where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home,

Wearing a wig?

Where the watermelons grow,
Back to my home,

Did you ever have a time,
When you couldnâ€™t make a rhyme?
Down by the bay!
