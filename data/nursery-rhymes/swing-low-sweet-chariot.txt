Refrain
Swing low sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Coming for to carry me home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home
Refrain
If you get there before I do
Coming for to carry me home
Tell all my friends I’m coming too
Coming for to carry me home
Refrain
I’m sometimes up and sometimes down
Coming for to carry me home
But still my soul feels heavenly bound
Coming for to carry me home
Refrain
The brightest day that I can say
Coming for to carry me home
When Jesus washed my sins away
Coming for to carry me home
Refrain
