(Chorus)
The cockroach, the cockroach,
Can’t walk anymore
Because it doesn’t have,
Because it’s missing
Two little back legs.
People they say the cockroach
Is a very small animal
And when it gets into a house,
It’ll soon be the master of it all.
(Chorus)
When a boy loves a girl
And she doesn’t love him back
It’s the same as if a bald man
Finds a comb on the railroad track*.
(Chorus)
My neighbor across the street
Had Lady Claire as her name
And if she hadn’t died
She still would be called the same.
(Chorus)
When Rita was bathing
In the San Fernando River
The cockroach stung her
But she kept on swimming.
(Chorus)
