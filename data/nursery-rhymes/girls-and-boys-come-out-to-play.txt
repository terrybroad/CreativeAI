Boys and girls come out to play,
The moon doth shine as bright as day,
Leave your supper,
and leave your sleep,
And come with your playfellows into the street.
Come with a whoop, come with a call,
Come with a good will, or not at all.
Up the ladder and down the wall,
A halfpenny loaf will serve us all.
You find milk, and I’ll find flour,
And we’ll have pudding within the hour.
