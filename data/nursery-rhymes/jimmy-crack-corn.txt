Jimmy crack corn, and I don’t care,
Jimmy crack corn, and I don’t care,
Jimmy crack corn, and I don’t care,
My master’s gone away.

He told me to plow, and I told him “No.”
He told me to sing, and I told him “No.”
He told me to play the old banjo,
And I called for rain and the winds did blow.

One day he rode around the farm,
The flies so numerous they did swarm,
One chanced to bite him on the thigh,
The devil take the blue-tail fly.
