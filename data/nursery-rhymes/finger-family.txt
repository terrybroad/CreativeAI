Daddy finger, daddy finger
where are you?
Here I am
here I am
How do you do?
Mommy finger, mommy finger
where are you?
Here I am, here I am
How do you do?
Brother finger, brother finger,
where are you?
Here I am, here I am
How do you do?
Sister finger, sister finger
where are you?
Here I am, here I am
How do you do?
Baby finger, baby finger
where are you?
Here I am, here I am
How do you do?
