I love to have a bath!
When I Splash I Laugh – Ha ha!
I love to have a bath!
Splash Splash
When Mummy shout’s “It’s Bathtime!”
I get excited and I just can’t hide it.
Bathtime is my funtime!
I can sail away to an unknown island.
I’m the pirate of my ship.
With my crew of rubber ducks!
Bathtime is my funtime!
Splash Splash Splash.
Splash Splash
I love to have a bath!
When I Splash I Laugh – Ha ha!
I love to have a bath!
Splash Splash
Getting clean is so much fun.
I love to watch the water run.
With Bubbles flying everywhere!
On my chin and in my hair.
Splash Splash Splash
Woah! I love it
Splash Splash Splash
Yeahhhhhh
Being in the bath is so much fun!
Are you ready?
Grab the sponge…
It’s time to get clean…
I love to wash my feet
wash my feet, wash my feet
I love to wash my feet
I love to wash my feet.
I love to wash my legs
wash my legs, wash my legs
I love to wash my legs
I love to wash my legs
I love to wash my arms
wash my arms, wash my arms
I love to wash my arms
I love to wash my arms
Splash Splash
I love to have a bath!
When I Splash I Laugh – Ha ha!
I love to have a bath!
Splash Splash
The time has come to wash my hair
Shampoo bubbles everywhere!
It smell’s so sweet – i’m nearly done
Bathtime has been so much fun.
I pull the plug and give a cheer
I watch the water disappear
It feels so good to be so clean.
What a fun time it has been.
