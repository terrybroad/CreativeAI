Willy boy, Willy boy, where are you going?
I will go with you, if I may.
I’m going to the meadow to see them a-mowing,
I’m going to help them make the hay.
Willy boy, Willy boy,
Where are you going?
I will go with you, if I may.
I am going to the meadows,
To see them mowing,
I am going to see them make hay.
