Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I’m found
Was blind, but now I see
‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace that fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
‘Tis grace has brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home.
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer’s ear
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds
And drives away his fear.
Must Jesus bear the cross alone
And all the world go free
No, there’s a cross for everyone
And there’s a cross for me.
When we’ve been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.
