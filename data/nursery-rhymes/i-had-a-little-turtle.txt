I had a little turtle,
His name was Tiny Tim.
I put him in the bathtub to see if he could swim.
He drank up all the water,
He ate a bar of soap.
And now heâ€™s lying in his bed
With bubbles in his throat.
Bubble, bubble, bubble,
Bubble, bubble, bubble,
Bubble, bubble, bubble,
Bubble, bubble, bubble
Pop!
