Ring a ring oâ€™ roses 
A pocketful of posies
a-tishoo, a-tishoo
We all fall down.
The King has sent his daughter
To fetch a pail of water
a-tishoo, a-tishoo
We all fall down.
The bird upon the steeple
Sits high above the people
a-tishoo, a-tishoo
We all fall down.
The cows are in the meadow
Lying fast asleep
a-tishoo, a-tishoo
We all get up again.
