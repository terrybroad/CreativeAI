… Oh in the woods there was a tree
The prettiest tree
You ever did see
And the tree was in the ground
And the green grass grew all around, all around, and the green grass grew all around
… And on that tree
There was a limb
The prettiest limb
That you ever did see
And the limb was on the tree
And the tree in the ground
And the green grass grew all around, all around, and the green grass grew all around
… And on that limb
There was a branch
The prettiest branch
That you ever did see
And the branch was on the limb,
And the limb was on the tree,
And the tree was in the ground
And the green grass grew all around, all around, and the green grass grew all around
… And on that branch
There was a nest
The prettiest nest
That you ever did see
And the nest was on the branch
And the branch was on the limb
And the limb was on the tree
And the tree was in the ground
And the green grass grew all around, all around, and the green grass grew all around
… And in that nest
There was an egg
The prettiest egg
That you ever did see
And the egg was in the nest
And the nest was on the branch
And the branch was on the limb
And the limb was on the tree
And the tree was in the ground
And the green grass grew all around, all around, and the green grass grew all around
… And in that egg
There was a bird
The prettiest bird
That you ever did see
And the bird was in the egg
And the egg was in the nest
And the nest was on the branch
And the branch was on the limb
And the limb was on the tree
And the tree was in the ground
And the green grass grew all around, all around, and the green grass grew all around
