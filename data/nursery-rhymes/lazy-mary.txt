Lazy Mary will you get up,
Will you get up today.
No, no mother I wont get up,
I wont get up, I wont get up.
No, no mother I wont get up,
I wont get up today.
Oh, dear Mary, you must get up,
You must get up, you must get up.
Oh, dear Mary, you must get up,
You must get up today.
Yes dear mother, I will get up,
I will get up, I will get up.
Yes dear mother I will get up,
