If all the raindrops
Were lemon drops and gumdrops
So what a rain that would be
Standing outside with my mouth open wide
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
If all the raindrops
Were lemon drops and gumdrops
Oh, what a rain that would be
I can get working
Oh, look at that
He, hope he gets everybody
Oh, come on
If all the snowflakes
Were candy bars and milkshakes
Oh, what a snow that would be
Standing outside with my mouth open wide
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
If all the snowflakes
Were candy bars and milkshakes
Oh, what a snow that would be
Yum, this is more milky
Yeah
If all the raindrops
Were lemon drops and gumdrops
Oh, what a rain that would be
Everybody
Standing outside with my mouth open wide
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
If all the raindrops
Were lemon drops and gumdrops
Oh, what a rain that would be
Iâ€™d be outside all day, me too
