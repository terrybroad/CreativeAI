Goosey goosey gander,
Whither shall I wander?
Upstairs and downstairs
And in my lady’s chamber.
There I met an old man
Who wouldn’t say his prayers,
So I took him by his left leg
And threw him down the stair
Original lyrics as first recorded in 1784:
Goose-a goose-a gander,
Where shall I wander?
Up stairs and down stairs,
In my lady’s chamber;
There you’ll find a cup of sack
And a race of ginger
An additional verse of another version of the song:
The stairs went crack,
He nearly broke his back.
And all the little ducks went,
‘Quack, quack, quack
