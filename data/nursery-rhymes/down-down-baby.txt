Down down baby, down by the roller coaster
Sweet, sweet baby, I’ll never let you go,
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa pops,
Shimmy shimmy pow!
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa pops,
Shimmy shimmy pow!
Grandma grandma, sick in bed,
Called the doctor and the doctor said;
Let’s get the rhythm of the head – ding dong!
Let’s get the rhythm of the head – ding dong!
Let’s get the rhythm of the hands – clap, clap!
Let’s get the rhythm of the hands – clap, clap!
Let’s get the rhythm of the feet – stomp, stomp!
Let’s get the rhythm of the feet – stomp, stomp!
Let’s get the rhythm of the – hot dog
Let’s get the rhythm of the – hot dog!
Put it all together and what do you get?
Ding dong, clap clap, stomp stomp, hot dog!
Put it all backward and what do you get?
Hot dog, stomp stomp, clap clap, ding dong!
