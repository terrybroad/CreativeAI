Autumn leaves are falling down
Falling down, falling down
Autumn leaves are falling down.
All around the town.
The wind will blow them round and round
Round and round, round and round.
The wind will blow them round and round
All around the town.
They’re drifting gently to the ground,
to the ground, to the ground.
They’re drifting gently to the ground.
All around the town.
Take a rake and rake them up,
Rake them up, rake them up.
Take a rake and rake them up
All around the town.
