Shoo fly, don’t bother me,
Shoo fly, don’t bother me,
Shoo fly, don’t bother me,
For I belong to somebody.
I feel, I feel,
I feel like a morning star.
I feel, I feel,
I feel like a morning star.
Shoo fly, don’t bother me,
Shoo fly, don’t bother me,
Shoo fly, don’t bother me,
For I belong to somebody.
