Chorus
On the bridge of Avignon
We’re all dancing, we’re all dancing
On the bridge of Avignon
We all dance in circles.
The fine gentlemen go like this
And then again like this.
Chorus
The beautiful ladies go like this
And then again like that.
Chorus
The young girls go like this
And then like that.
Chorus
The musicians go like this
And then like that.
