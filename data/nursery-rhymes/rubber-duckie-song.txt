Well, here I am in my tubby again
And my tubby’s all filled with water and nice fluffy suds
And I’ve got my soap and washcloth to wash myself
And I’ve got my nifty scrub brush to help me scrub my back
And I’ve got a big fluffy towel to dry myself when I’m done
But there’s one other thing that makes tubby time the very best time of the whole day
And do you know what that is?
It’s a very special friend of mine my very favorite little pal
Rubber duckie you’re the one
You make bath time lots of fun
Rubber duckie I’m awfully fond of you
Rubber duckie joy of joys
When I squeeze you, you make noise
Rubber duckie you’re my very best friend it’s true
Oh, every day when I make my way to the tubby
I find a little fellow who’s cute and yellow and chubby
Rub-a-dub-dubby
Rubber duckie, you’re so fine
And I’m lucky that you’re mine
Rubber duckie, I’m awfully fond of you
Hey, rubber duckie would you like me to scrub your back with my little nifty scrub brush?
You would okay, how’s this?
Hey, you want me to scrub behind your ears?
Oh, I see you don’t have any ears, do you?
Well, how about your tummy?
Scrub his little duckie tummy
Oh, he’s ticklish oh-hoo
Oh, every day when I make my way to the tubby
I find a little fellow who’s cute and yellow and chubby
Rub-a-dub-dubby!
Rubber duckie, you’re so fine
And I’m lucky that you’re mine
Rubber duckie, I’d like a whole pond of
Rubber duckie, I’m awfully fond of you
