a little bit, but nice,

I’ll eat it fast,
I will, Says F,
I vow I’ll have my fill,

the border’s what I love,

it makes your teeth to chatter,

it’s nice, there’s nought the matter,

others’ plates with grief surveyed,

for a large piece begged and prayed,

quarrelled for the topmost slice,

rubbed his hands and said “it’s nice,”

silent sat, and simply looked,

thought, and said, it’s nicely cooked,

understood the fruit was cherry,

vanished when they all got merry,
W
wished there’d been a quince
in, X
here explained he’d need convincing,
