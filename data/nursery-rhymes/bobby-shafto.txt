Bobby Shafto’s gone to sea,
Silver buckles at his knee;
He’ll come back and marry me,
Bonny Bobby Shafto!
Bobby Shafto’s bright and fair,
Panning out his yellow hair;
He’s my love for evermore,
Bonny Bobby Shafto!
Additional lyrics were added in 1812 in Rhymes of Northern Bards, by in John Bell.
Bobby Shafto’s getten a bairn,
For to dangle on his arm;
In his arm and on his knee,
Bobby Shafto loves me.
