Good evening, good night,
With roses covered,
With cloves adorned,
Slip under the covers.
Tomorrow morning, if God wills,
you will wake once again.

Good evening, good night.
By angels watched,
Who show you in your dream
the Christ-childâ€™s tree.
Sleep now blissfully and sweetly,
see paradise in your dreams.
