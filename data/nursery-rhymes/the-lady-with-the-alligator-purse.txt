Miss Lucy had a baby, his name was Tiny Tim
She put him in the bathtub to see if he could swim
He drank up all the water, he ate up all the soap
He tried to eat the bathtub but it wouldn’t go down his throat
Miss Lucy called the doctor, Miss Lucy called the nurse
Miss Lucy called the lady with the alligator purse
In came the doctor, in came the nurse.
In came the lady with the alligator purse
“Chicken pox,” said the doctor, “Measles,” said the nurse
“Nonsense,” said the lady with the alligator purse
“Penicillin,” said the doctor, “Castor oil,” said the nurse
“Pizza,” said the lady with alligator purse
