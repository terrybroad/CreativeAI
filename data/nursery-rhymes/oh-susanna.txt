I come from Alabama
With my banjo on my knee,
I’m going to Louisiana,
My true love for to see.
Oh, Susanna,
Oh don’t you cry for me,
For I come from Alabama,
With my banjo on my knee.
It rained all night
The day I left
The weather it was dry
The sun so hot,
I froze to death
Susanna, don’t you cry.
Oh, Susanna,
Oh don’t you cry for me,
For I come from Alabama,
With my banjo on my knee.
I had a dream the other night,
When everything was still,
I thought I saw Susanna,
A-coming down the hill.
Oh, Susanna,
Oh don’t you cry for me,
For I come from Alabama,
With my banjo on my knee.
The buckwheat cake,
Was in her mouth,
The tear was
In her eye,
Says I, I’m coming from the south,
Susanna, don’t you cry.
Oh, Susanna,
Oh don’t you cry for me,
For I come from Alabama,
With my banjo on my knee.
