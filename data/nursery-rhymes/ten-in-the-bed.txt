There were ten in the bed
And the little one said,
“Roll over! Roll over!”
So they all rolled over and
one fell out
There were nine in the bed
And the little one said,
“Roll over! Roll over!”
So they all rolled over
And one fell out
There were eight in the bed
And the little one said,
“Roll over! Roll over!”
So they all rolled over and one fell out
There were seven in the bed
And the little one said,
“Roll over! Roll over!”
So they all rolled over and one fell out
There were six in the bed
And the little one said,
“Roll over! Roll over!”
So they all rolled over and one fell out
There were five in the bed
And the little one said,
“Roll over! Roll over!”
So they all rolled over and one fell out
There were four in the bed
And the little one said,
“Roll over! Roll over!”
So they all rolled over and one fell out
There were three in the bed
And the little one said,
“Roll over! Roll over!”
So they all rolled over and one fell out
There were two in the bed
And the little one said,
“Roll over! Roll over!”
So they all rolled over and one fell out
There was one in the bed
And the little one said,
“Alone at last!”
“Good Night!”
