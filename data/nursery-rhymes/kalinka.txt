(Chorus)
Little red berry,
Little red berry of mine!
In the garden is a little raspberry,
My little raspberry!
Under the green pine tree
Lay me down to sleep
Oh, lyuli, lyuli, oh, lyuli, lyuli,*
Lay me down to sleep.
(Chorus)
Beautiful woman, soul-maiden,
Fall in love with me!
Oh, lyuli, lyuli, oh, lyuli, lyuli,
Fall in love with me!
(Chorus)
