As I was a-goin’
On down the road
With a tired team
And a heavy load
I cracked my whip
And the leader sprung
I says day-day
To the wagon tongue
Turkey in the straw
Turkey in the hay
Turkey in the straw
Turkey in the hay
Roll ’em up and twist ’em up
A high tuck a-haw
And hit ’em up a tune called
Turkey in the Straw
Went out to milk
And I didn’t know how
I milked the goat
Instead of the cow
A monkey sittin’
On a pile of straw
A winkin’ at
His mother-in-law
Turkey in the straw
Turkey in the hay
Turkey in the straw
Turkey in the hay
Roll ’em up and twist ’em up
A high tuck a-haw
And hit ’em up a tune called
Turkey in the Straw
I came to the river
And I couldn’t get across
So I paid five dollars
For a big bay hoss
Well, he wouldn’t go ahead
And he wouldn’t stand still
So he went up and down
Like an old saw mill
Turkey in the straw
Turkey in the hay
Turkey in the straw
Turkey in the hay
Roll ’em up and twist ’em up
A high tuck a-haw
And hit ’em up a tune called
Turkey in the Straw
Did you ever go fishin’
On a warm summer day
When all the fish
Were swimmin’ in the bay
With their hands in their pockets
And their pockets in their pants
Did you ever see a fishie
Do the Hootchy-Kootchy Dance?
Turkey in the straw
Turkey in the hay
Turkey in the straw
Turkey in the hay
Roll ’em up and twist ’em up
A high tuck a-haw
And hit ’em up a tune called
Turkey in the Straw
