Wake up, my love, wake up.
Look at what has dawned,
Already the little birds are singing,
The moon already went in.
How pretty is the morning
In which I come to greet you.
We all came with pleasure
and joy to congratulate you.
On the day you were born
All the flowers were born.
At the baptismal font
The mockingbirds sang.
It is starting to be dawn,
The day has given us light.
Get up in the morning,
Look that it has already dawned.
