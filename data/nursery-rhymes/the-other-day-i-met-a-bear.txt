The other day
I met a bear
A great big bear
A way out there.

He looked at me
I looked at him
He sized up me
I sized up him.

He said to me
Why don’t you run
I see you don’t
Have any gun.

And so I ran
Away from there
And right behind
Me was that bear.

Ahead of me
I saw a tree
A great, big tree
Oh, golly gee!

The lowest branch
Was ten feet up
I’d had to jump
And trust my luck!

And so I jumped
Into the air
And missed that branch
A way up there.

Now don’t you fret
And don’t you frown
I caught that branch
On the way back down.

That’s all there is
There is no more
Until I meet
That bear once more.

The end, the end,
The end, the end,
The end, the end,
The end, the end.
