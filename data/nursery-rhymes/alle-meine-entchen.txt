All my ducklings
Swimming on the lake,
Swimming on the lake,
Heads in the water,
Little tails up in the air!
All my little doves
Sitting on the roof,
Sitting on the roof;
Clipper, clapper, clap, clap,
They fly over the roof.
All my chickens
Scratching in the straw
Scratching in the straw
Find a little grain,
Theyâ€™re all happy.
All my goslings
Waddle across the ground,
Waddle across the ground,
Search in the pond,
Become round like a ball.
