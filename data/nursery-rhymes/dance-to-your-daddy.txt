Come here, my little Jacky
Now I’ve smoked my backey
Let’s have a bit crackey
Till the boat comes in
Chorus:
Dance to thy daddy, sing to thy mammy,
Dance to thy daddy, to thy mammy sing;
Thou shalt have a fishy on a little dishy,
Thou shalt have a fishy when the boat comes in.
Here’s thy mother humming,
Like a canny woman;
Yonder comes thy father,
Drunk – he cannot stand.
Chorus
Our Tommy’s always fuddling,
He’s so fond of ale,
But he’s kind to me,
I hope he’ll never fail.
Chorus
I like a drop mysel’,
When I can get it sly,
And thou, my bonny bairn,
Will lik’t as well as I.
Chorus
May we get a drop,
Oft as we stand in need;
And weel may the keel row
That brings the bairns their bread.
Chorus
