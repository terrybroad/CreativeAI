Draw a pail of water,
For my lady’s daughter;
My father’s a king, and my mother’s a queen,
My two little sisters are dressed in green,
Stamping grass and parsley,
Marigold leaves and daisies.
One rush! two rush!
Pray thee, fine lady, come under my bush.
Draw a Bucket of Water Lyrics
Draw a bucket of water
For my lady’s daughter.
One in a rush and
Two in a rush
And the first old lady pops under.
Draw a bucket of water
For my lady’s daughter.
One in a rush and
Two in a rush
And the second old lady pops under.
Draw a bucket of water
For my lady’s daughter.
One in a rush and
Two in a rush
And the third old lady pops under.
Draw a bucket of water
For my lady’s daughter.
One in a rush and
Two in a rush
And the fourth old lady pops under.
Draw a bucket of water
For my lady’s daughter.
One in a rush and
Two in a rush
And we all pop out!
