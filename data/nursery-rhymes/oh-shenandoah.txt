Oh Shenandoah,
I long to hear you,
Away you rolling river,
Oh Shenandoah,
I long to hear you,
Away, I’m bound away
Cross the wide Missouri.
Oh Shenandoah,
I love your daughter,
Away you rolling river,
I’ll take her ‘cross
That rollin’ water,
Away, I’m bound away
Cross the wide Missouri.
This white man loves
Your Indian maiden,
Away you rolling river
In my canoe
With notions laden
Away, I’m bound away
Cross the wide Missouri.
Farewell, goodbye,
I shall not grieve you,
Away you rolling river,
Oh Shenandoah,
I’ll not deceive you
Away, we’re bound away
Cross the wide Missouri.
