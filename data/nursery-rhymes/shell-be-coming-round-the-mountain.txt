She’ll be coming ’round the mountain when she comes, when she comes
She’ll be coming ’round the mountain when she comes
She’ll be coming ’round the mountain,
She’ll be coming ’round the mountain
She’ll be coming ’round the mountain when she comes.
She’ll be huffin’ and a-puffin’…
Oh, we’ll all come out to meet her …
We will kill the old red rooster…
She’ll be wearing pink pajamas…
(plus some bawdy ones)
Everybody asks her, did she come.
Everybody asks her, did she come.
They wouldn’t have to mention
If they only paid attention.
Everybody asks her, did she come.
