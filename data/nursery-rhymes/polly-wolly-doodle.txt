Oh, I went down South
For to see my Sal
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
My Sal, she is A spunky gal
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
Fare thee well, Fare thee well,
Fare thee well my fairy fay
For I’m going to Lou’siana For to see my Susyanna
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
Oh, my Sal, she is A maiden fair
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
With curly eyes And laughing hair
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
Fare thee well, Fare thee well,
Fare thee well my fairy fay
For I’m going to Lou’siana For to see my Susyanna
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
Behind the barn, Down on my knees
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
I thought I heard A chicken sneeze
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
Fare thee well, Fare thee well,
Fare thee well my fairy fay
For I’m going to Lou’siana For to see my Susyanna
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
He sneezed so hard With the whooping cough
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
He sneezed his head And the tail right off
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
Fare thee well, Fare thee well,
Fare thee well my fairy fay
For I’m going to Lou’siana For to see my Susyanna
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
Oh, a grasshopper sittin’ On a railroad track
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
A-pickin’ his teeth
With a carpet tack
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
Fare thee well,
Fare thee well,
Fare thee well my fairy fay
For I’m going to Lou’siana For to see my Susyanna
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
Oh, I went to bed But it wasn’t any use
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
My feet stuck out Like a chicken roost
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
Fare thee well, Fare thee well,
Fare thee well my fairy fay
For I’m going to Lou’siana For to see my Susyanna
Sing Polly wolly doodle all the day
