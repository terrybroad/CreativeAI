Down from the Sierra Morena mountains,
Pretty little darling, they come,
A pair of black eyes,
Pretty little darling, they’re contraband!
(Chorus)
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Sing and do not cry
Because singing cheers up,
Pretty little darling, our hearts.
That mole that you have,
Pretty little darling, near the mouth,
Don’t give it to anyone,
Pretty little darling, it’s for me to play with.
(Chorus)
The bird that leaves,
Pretty little darling, its first nest,
Comes back and finds it occupied
Pretty little darling, that’s what it deserves.
(Chorus)
An arrow in the air,
Pretty little darling, launched by Cupid
As he was playing,
Pretty little darling, I was the wounded one.
(Chorus)
From your house to mine,
Pretty little darling, there is no more than one step,
Before your mother comes,
Pretty little darling, give me a hug.
(Chorus)
