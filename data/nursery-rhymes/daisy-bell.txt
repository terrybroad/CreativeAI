Daisy, Daisy give me your answer do.
I’m half crazy all for the love of you.
It won’t be a stylish marriage,
I can’t afford a carriage.
But you’ll look sweet,
Upon the seat,
Of a bicycle made for two.
Michael, Micheal, here is your answer true.
I’m not crazy all for the love of you.
There won’t be any marriage,
If you can’t afford a carriage.
‘Cause I’ll be switched,
If I get hitched,
On a bicycle built for two!”
